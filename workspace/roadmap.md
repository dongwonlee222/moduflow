# ModuFlow Roadmap

## Now

No active core goal issues remain. Issues 019 through 024 are released locally.

## Backlog / Existing Capabilities

### `024-artifact-schema-and-doctor-gates`

- Outcome: Doctor validates artifact relationships, state drift, Git binding, intake records, worker plans, and next-command consistency, not only file existence.
- Reason: A richer loop model needs stronger consistency checks.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: loop state from 019, Git binding from 021, intake routing from 022, and worker routing from 023
- Next command: `product:status`

### `023-worker-routing-and-isolation`

- Outcome: Worker assignment and parallel execution are now deterministic, file/dependency aware, and sequential by default when unsafe.
- Reason: Workers should help only when work can be safely split and merged.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: Git binding from 021 and intake routing from 022
- Next command: `product:status`

### `022-intake-to-goal-graph`

- Outcome: Loose requests classify into active issue attachment, new issue candidates, goal graph candidates, or inbox routing records.
- Reason: This is the main product value beyond Spec Kit and coding agents.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: simple UX from 020 and goal graph from 019
- Next command: `product:status`

### `021-git-binding-and-execution-backend`

- Outcome: Issues and loop steps are tied to branches, commits, PRs, releases, and optional execution backends such as Copilot Cloud Agent, Codex, Claude Code, OpenHands, or manual work.
- Reason: ModuFlow should orchestrate execution rather than compete with coding agents.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: loop state model from 019
- Next command: `product:status`

### `020-user-facing-simple-loop-ux`

- Outcome: Simple aliases shipped for `상태`, `다음`, `이거 해줘`, and guarded `완료` while preserving direct `product:*` commands.
- Reason: Internal loop complexity must not increase user complexity.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: loop state model from 019
- Next command: `product:status`

### `019-loop-kernel-and-state-model`

- Outcome: Durable goal-loop state model shipped for Goal 1:N Issue, active cursor, attempts guard, and drift-aware validation.
- Reason: This is the core foundation for making ModuFlow a PM loop orchestrator instead of a collection of workflow commands.
- Confidence: high
- Dependency: current artifact tracking and doctor gates
- Next command: `product:status`
