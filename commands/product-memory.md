# /product:memory

Manage repo-local project memory for deliverables, decisions, evidence, meetings, releases, notes, and references.

## PM-Friendly Flow

1. Initialize memory:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --write
```

2. **Capture relationships at write time (043).** Before creating an entry, list existing ids so you link to *real* nodes — never free-type ids, never auto-link by topic:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --list-ids          # all entries (id/kind/title)
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --list-ids --kind decision   # filter by kind
```

Then, when writing, pass the relationships you can **content-verify** plus the `issue_id`:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --candidate --kind decision --title "Use Git canonical memory" --issue-id 034-memory-capture-and-sync-workflow --spec specs/034-memory-capture-and-sync-workflow/spec.md --summary "Keep memory canonical in Git-tracked Markdown." --source-event decision-detected --source-artifacts specs/034-memory-capture-and-sync-workflow/spec.md --supersedes 2026-06-24-use-portable-project-memory --references 2026-06-25-some-evidence --tags memory,team,pm
```

- Always set `--issue-id` when the entry came from an issue — this is what fills the issue↔memory cross-links the 045 project view shows.
- Pass `--supersedes` / `--depends-on` / `--references` only for links you can justify from the content. **Present options, never auto-link** (042's anti-goal). Relationships survive `--approve` unchanged.
- `product:doctor` surfaces "isolated" entries (no links, no issue_id) as an informational hint — a nudge to link, never a hard failure.

3. Review candidates:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --list-candidates
```

4. Approve a candidate:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --approve 2026-06-26-use-git-canonical-memory
```

5. Search with source links and match reasons:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --search "canonical memory"
```

6. Get mirror/export guidance:

```bash
python3 scripts/project_memory.py <project-path> --export-guidance google-drive
```

## Rules

- `memory/` is the source of truth.
- External indexes, MCP servers, vector stores, and databases are rebuildable caches/adapters.
- Prefer relative project-local links so projects remain portable when copied, cloned, or zipped.
- Do not import private personal memory into a project automatically.
- In team mode, shared memory should be approved through Git branch/PR review before merge.
- RAG, LangGraph, MCP servers, Basic Memory, projectmem, mem0, Supermemory, Google Drive, and Obsidian are adapters or mirrors, not the source of truth.
- PMs can approve memory candidates through natural language; implementation hosts may translate that approval into the CLI calls above.

## Next

- `/product:evidence` to review related memory and evidence
- `/product:decision` when a memory entry supports a decision
